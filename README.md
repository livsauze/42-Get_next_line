âœ… 125 %

## DESCRIPTION

This project challenges you to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor (fd) and returns it.
You will discover what a static variable is and dig into dynamic memory allocation. 

You will be able to add the function to your libft. 

## FUNCTION PROTOTYPE

get_next_line() has the following prototype :
`char *get_netx_line(int fd);`

## BONUS PART

For the bonus part, get_next_line() has to handle multiple fd and with only one static variable.
